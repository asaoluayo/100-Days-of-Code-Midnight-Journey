\# 100 Days of Code – My Journey to Becoming a Midnight Builder



Hey there! 👋  

I'm SAMZ (@ayoasaolu01 on X), a Mathematics student at the University of Lagos, Midnight ambassador, and someone who's finally starting his #100DaysOfCode challenge today, January 25, 2026.



Why I’m Just Starting Now 



I had planned to start this last week, but real life hit hard:



\- My elder brother had his convocation last week—family came from everywhere, we were all celebrating, running around, taking photos. It was beautiful, but it took up a lot of time and energy.

\- On top of that, school work has been crazy for me—assignments piling up, exams prep, group projects, and just trying to survive Unilag life.

\- Between family, academics, and ambassador duties, every time I tried to sit down and code seriously, something would come up and I'd push it back and then postpone.



I kept telling myself "next week for real," but next week never came… until today.



Why I’m Finally Starting (and Why I Won’t Stop This Time)



Because I’m tired of waiting for the "perfect" moment.  

Because I believe privacy is the future, and Midnight is building exactly that—rational, programmable privacy that can actually protect people (especially here in Nigeria and Africa).  

Because as a Midnight ambassador, I don’t just want to talk about it, I want to build on it.



So starting today, I’m committing to 2 hours of coding every single day for the next 100 days. No more excuses. I’ll document everything here: code, notes, struggles, wins, screenshots, and lessons.



The Roadmap (High-Level)



1\. Days 1–18: Refresh \& solidify JavaScript fundamentals (Jonas Schmedtmann course)  

2\. Days 19–45: Master TypeScript (types, generics, async — bridge to Compact)  

3\. Days 46–65: Blockchain basics + intro to zero-knowledge proofs  

4\. Days 66–85: Deep dive into Compact (Midnight’s smart contract language)  

5\. Days 86–100: Build and deploy my first real privacy dApp on Midnight Devnet



By the end, my goal is simple:  

\- Deploy a working Compact contract  

\- Ship a small privacy-focused dApp  

\- Encourage other builders (especially newcomers) to jump into Midnight





This repo is my public proof of consistency.  

Follow along on X (@ayoasaolu01) where I’ll be posting daily stories — the good, the bad, the bugs, the breakthroughs.  



If you're reading this:  

\- Feel free to star/fork the repo  

\- Drop suggestions, tips, or questions in the issues or on X  

\- If you're also building on Midnight or learning JS/TS/ZK — let's connect!



Privacy is the future.  

And today is Day 1.
